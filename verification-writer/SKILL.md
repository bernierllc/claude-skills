# Verification Writer

## Overview

Analyze a codebase to generate and maintain manual verification docs for use by the browser-verification skill. Audit every route, component, and interaction point across all user types. Check whether graceful error handling exists. Produce verification checklists AND a findings report of gaps.

**Core principle:** Every user-facing interaction has a happy path and failure paths. Both must be verifiable. If code doesn't handle failure gracefully, that's a finding — flag it, fix it if small, or report it.

**Relationship to browser-verification:** This skill creates and maintains the docs. Browser-verification executes against them. The two form a feedback loop.

## Entry Points

Determine which applies from context:

| Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|
| **New project** | Full scan: all routes, all user types, complete `docs/verification/` scaffold |
| **New feature** | Git diff to find changed/added files, trace to routes and components, generate items for affected sections |
| **After code changes** | Same as new feature + check existing docs for staleness against current code |
| **On demand** | User specifies route, feature, or role — scan just that scope |
| **Called by browser-verification** | Specific items are stale/missing — update those sections, re-validate |

## Checklist

You MUST complete these in order:

1. **Determine scope and entry point**
2. **Run Phase 1: Codebase Analysis**
3. **Run Phase 2: Generate outputs**
4. **Apply fixes within thresholds**
5. **Run test suite to verify fixes**
6. **Produce findings report**
7. **Suggest verification run**

## Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

Read `references/codebase-analysis.md` for detailed heuristics. Summary:

### Layer 1: User Types and Access

- Scan auth config, middleware, role definitions, database schema for user/role tables
- Build a matrix of every user type in the system
- For each route: determine which user types can access it and which should be denied

### Layer 2: Route Discovery

- Walk `app/` directory structure for all page routes (dynamic, catch-all, parallel, layouts, error boundaries, loading/not-found)
- Map `app/api/` endpoints to the UI routes that call them
- Run `scripts/route-scanner.py` for deterministic directory walk if available; otherwise walk manually

### Layer 3: Component Analysis

- For each route, read the page file and trace imports
- Categorize: forms (fields, validation), tables (sort/filter/pagination), CRUD operations, modals, navigation, state-dependent UI
- Flag shared components (used across multiple routes)

### Layer 4: Error Path Analysis

For every interaction point from Layer 3, determine error handling status:

| Interaction | What constitutes graceful handling |
|---|---|
| Form submission | Client-side AND server-side validation, user-facing error messages, no exposed stack traces |
| API calls | try/catch or error boundary, meaningful error UI, loading/error states |
| Auth boundaries | Middleware redirects unauthorized users, no flash of protected content |
| Data loading | Loading state, empty state, handles null/undefined without crash |
| Destructive actions | Confirmation dialog, failure of the action itself handled |
| External dependencies | Service-down fallback, degraded state rather than crash |

Record each as:
- **Handled** — graceful error handling exists. Document expected behavior.
- **Partial** — some handling exists, incomplete. Document what exists, flag what's missing.
- **Missing** — no error handling. Goes in findings report.

**Code is the source of truth.** Tests are a hint for discovering intended error paths, but the code determines what actually exists.

## Phase 2: Generate Outputs

Read `references/verification-item-format.md` for item syntax details.

### Output 1: Verification Docs (`docs/verification/*.md`)

One file per user type/role. Each covers all routes that user type can access.

**Item format:** `- [ ] [depth] **Action** --- Expected result. *Expected: type*`

**Depth tags:** `smoke`, `standard`, `deep` — must match browser-verification tiers.

**Expectation types:**
- `success` — happy path works
- `warning dialog` — warned before destructive action
- `client-side validation error` — bad input caught before server
- `graceful server error` — server rejects, UI handles gracefully
- `auth boundary enforcement` — access control works
- `success with side effects` — works AND downstream effects happen
- `graceful empty state` — no-data scenario handled appropriately

**Generation rules:**
- Every route gets at minimum a `[smoke]` item (page loads without error)
- Every form gets `[standard]` items for valid submission AND `[deep]` items for empty/invalid/boundary submissions
- Every CRUD operation gets `[standard]` items for each operation AND `[deep]` items for conflict/failure states
- Every auth boundary gets `[standard]` items for wrong-role access
- Every destructive action gets `[standard]` items verifying the confirmation flow
- Every error path that has graceful handling gets a `[deep]` item to verify the graceful behavior

**Items for Partial/Missing handling:** If error handling is Partial, write the item documenting what SHOULD happen (so browser-verification will find the gap). If Missing, write the item only after the fix is applied or note it in the findings report.

### Output 2: Findings Report (`docs/verification/findings/YYYY-MM-DD-analysis.md`)

Read `references/findings-report-format.md` for full template.

Always generated, even if zero gaps found. Includes:
- Summary stats (routes analyzed, interaction points, handled/partial/missing counts)
- Auto-fixes applied (with file/line details)
- Gaps requiring manual fix (with severity, current vs. expected behavior, suggested approach)
- Systemic issues (patterns affecting multiple routes/user types)

### Output 3: Index (`docs/verification/index.md`)

Master index: all verification files, prerequisites, login credentials, date each file was last generated/updated.

## Fix Behavior

Thresholds identical to browser-verification — ALL must be true:
- < 75 lines of changes
- Isolated to <= 3 components
- Isolated to <= 2 routes
- Does NOT touch shared code (shared components, utilities, middleware, hooks used across features)

**Can fix:**
- Missing client-side validation on a form
- Missing error boundary wrapper on a route
- Missing confirmation dialog on destructive action (if ConfirmDialog component already exists in codebase)
- Missing loading/empty states

**Must log as gap:**
- No consistent error handling pattern across the app
- Shared component needs error handling but used by 5+ routes
- Auth middleware needs restructuring
- Database constraints missing
- Third-party integration has no fallback

**After every fix:**
1. Update the verification doc to reflect the fix
2. Add to findings report under "Auto-Fixes Applied"
3. Run the project's test suite — if tests fail, revert and log as gap instead

## Cross-Skill Integration

### When invoked by browser-verification

Browser-verification sends a payload describing what's stale:
- Section and route affected
- Stale items (UI changed, behavior changed)
- Missing items (uncovered elements found)
- Fixed items (verification updated behavior during a run)

Re-analyze that specific section against current code. Update the doc. Return control to browser-verification.

### After generating/updating docs

Suggest (do not auto-invoke) a verification run:

> "Verification docs updated for [scope]. Run `/browser-verification` at smoke depth to confirm these items are accurate?"

## Log and Report Management

**On first run in a project (no existing `docs/verification/` directory):** Ask the user two questions before generating outputs:

1. **Git tracking:** "Should verification logs and findings reports be tracked in git, or should I add `docs/verification/logs/` and `docs/verification/findings/` to `.gitignore`?"
   - If gitignored: add both paths to `.gitignore`
   - If tracked: leave `.gitignore` unchanged — logs become part of project history
   - Default suggestion: track findings reports (they document code quality over time), gitignore run logs (they're ephemeral)

2. **Old report cleanup:** "Should I clean up old findings reports, or keep them all for history?"
   - If cleanup: keep only the most recent 5 findings reports, delete older ones
   - If keep all: leave everything
   - This question applies to findings only — verification docs themselves are never auto-deleted

**On subsequent runs:** Check the established pattern (is `.gitignore` already configured?) and follow it. Don't re-ask unless the user brings it up.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Generating items for code that doesn't exist yet | Code is source of truth — only document what's actually in the codebase |
| Skipping error path analysis | Every interaction point gets Layer 4 analysis, no exceptions |
| Writing items without expectation types | Every item must have `*Expected: type*` — browser-verification needs this |
| Fixing shared code without asking | Check import graph — if used across features, log as gap |
| Generating docs without checking for existing ones | Always read existing `docs/verification/` first — update, don't overwrite |
| Trusting tests over code | Tests are hints. Code is truth. Tests may be stale. |
| Ignoring partial handling | Partial is not handled — flag what's missing |
| Not running test suite after fixes | Every fix must be verified by tests before committing |

## Red Flags — STOP

- About to overwrite manually-curated verification docs without checking diff
- Fix touches shared code or exceeds thresholds
- Analysis shows systemic absence of error handling (> 50% of interaction points missing) — this needs architecture discussion, not item-by-item fixes
- User type discovery finds no roles — auth system may not be conventional, ask the user
