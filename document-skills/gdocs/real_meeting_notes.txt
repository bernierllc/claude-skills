üìù Meeting Notes ‚Äî Customer Feedback on To-Do App

Date: October 31, 2025
Attendees:

Product Manager: Sarah Lin

Customer: Alex Rivera

1. Purpose

To gather customer insights about their favorite to-do app, understand why they love it, and identify opportunities for improvement or new feature ideas.

2. Customer's Current To-Do App Usage

App: Todoist (primary), with occasional use of Apple Reminders for personal items.

Usage Context:

Uses it daily for work and personal planning.

Keeps multiple project lists (Work, Home, Travel, Personal Development).

Syncs across devices (phone, laptop, tablet).

Integrates with Google Calendar and Slack.

What They Love:

Simplicity & Clean Interface: Easy to add and view tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

Smart Scheduling: Automatic suggestion of due dates and prioritization.

Recurring Tasks: Particularly likes natural language input ("every Monday," "next week").

Cross-Platform Sync: Seamless experience across devices.

Karma System: The gamified progress tracker helps them stay motivated.

3. Pain Points & Improvement Areas

Challenges:

Overwhelming task lists: Wants more intelligent grouping or "focus mode" to hide non-urgent tasks.

Limited Collaboration: Hard to assign and track shared tasks across teams or family members.

Lack of Context: Tasks often need attachments (notes, screenshots, or links) for context.

Notifications: Too frequent or generic; would prefer more personalized reminders based on time of day or location.

4. Desired Features & Suggestions

5. Product Manager Observations

Customer is power-user adjacent: uses advanced features but still values simplicity.

Main opportunity areas: task context, intelligent filtering, and adaptive reminders.

Potential direction: blend productivity and personal well-being ‚Äî an app that reduces cognitive load instead of adding more lists.
