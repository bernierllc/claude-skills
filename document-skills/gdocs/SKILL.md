# Google Docs Intelligent Merge Skill

## Overview

This skill transforms raw meeting notes, transcripts, and research into professional, document-appropriate content for Google Docs. It doesn't just insert content - it **analyzes**, **synthesizes**, and **integrates** intelligently.

**Key Innovation:** Converts 3000+ character meeting transcripts into 3-sentence executive summaries that match your document's tone, style, and purpose.

## What This Skill Does

### ❌ What We DON'T Do (Smart Dumping)
```
User: "Merge these meeting notes"
❌ Bad: Appends entire 3000-char transcript to document
Result: Document bloated, unprofessional, not presentation-ready
```

### ✅ What We DO (Intelligent Synthesis)
```
User: "Merge these meeting notes"
✅ Good:
  1. Analyzes document (executive proposal, formal tone)
  2. Extracts key insights from notes
  3. Synthesizes into 3 sentences matching document style
  4. Inserts with proper formatting
  5. Adds attribution comment
Result: Professional, presentation-ready integration
```

## Current Capabilities (Phases 1-5 Complete)

### 1. Document Analysis
- Reads document structure (headings, sections, content)
- Identifies purpose, audience, tone, and style
- Analyzes section length patterns
- Reads existing comments
- Calculates optimal insertion points

### 2. Intelligent Content Synthesis
- **Extracts key insights** from raw source material
- **Matches document tone** (executive vs detailed, formal vs casual)
- **Matches section length** (3 sentences vs 3000 chars)
- **Maintains narrative flow** (natural continuation)
- **Presentation-ready output** (no meeting note artifacts)

### 3. Smart Insertion
- Comment-aware insertion (preserves existing comments)
- Proper formatting (NORMAL_TEXT style, prevents header inheritance)
- Section-targeted placement
- Atomic batch operations

### 4. Source Attribution
- Document-level comments citing source
- Timestamp and author information
- References to full notes location

### 5. Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 secure authentication
- One-time setup with automatic token refresh
- No need to re-authenticate

## Setup Required

Before using this skill, you must complete one-time setup (~5-10 minutes):

1. **Set up OAuth credentials**
   - Follow `auth/oauth_setup.md` step-by-step guide
   - Create Google Cloud project
   - Enable Google Docs API and Drive API
   - Download `credentials.json` to `auth/` directory

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Authenticate** (first use only)
   ```bash
   python examples/test_auth.py
   ```
   Browser will open for you to grant permissions. Tokens are saved for future use.

## How to Use This Skill

### Interactive Workflow (Recommended)

When the user provides meeting notes and a Google Doc URL, Claude (in conversation) will:

1. **Read both** documents
2. **Analyze** document purpose, style, and tone
3. **Propose synthesis** with preview:
   ```
   "I'll extract these 3 key insights and add 2-3 sentences to the
   Market Analysis section that match your executive tone:

   [Preview of synthesized content]

   Should I proceed?"
   ```
4. **Execute** after user approval:
   - Synthesize content
   - Insert at optimal location
   - Set NORMAL_TEXT style (proper formatting)
   - Add attribution comment

### Python API (Programmatic)

```python
from scripts.gdocs_editor import GoogleDocsEditor
from scripts.content_inserter import ContentInserter, MergeOptions

editor = GoogleDocsEditor()
inserter = ContentInserter(editor)

# Merge with intelligent synthesis (handled by Claude in conversation)
result = inserter.merge_content(
    doc_url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/DOC_ID/edit",
    content="[Synthesized content from Claude's analysis]",
    section="Market Analysis",
    options=MergeOptions(
        preserve_comments=True,
        add_source_comment=True,
        source_description="meeting on 2025-10-31"
    )
)

print(f"✓ Inserted at index {result['insertion_point'].index}")
print(f"✓ Comment ID: {result['new_comment_id']}")
```

## Core Principles (MUST FOLLOW)

### 1. ANALYZE FIRST

Before synthesizing any content:
- **Document Purpose:** Proposal? Report? Memo? Presentation?
- **Target Audience:** Executives? Team? Customers? Technical?
- **Style & Tone:** Formal? Casual? Technical? Executive summary?
- **Section Patterns:** Concise (3 sentences) vs detailed (3 pages)?
- **Narrative Flow:** How does this section connect to others?

### 2. EXTRACT INSIGHTS, DON'T DUMP

From source material (meeting notes, transcripts, research):
- What are the **3-5 KEY insights**?
- What **data/evidence** supports the document's thesis?
- What **conclusions** are actionable?
- What can be **safely omitted**?

**Warning Signs:**
- ❌ Copying entire sections of notes
- ❌ Using note-taking language ("Attendees:", "Action Items:")
- ❌ Inserting content 3x longer than existing section
- ❌ Breaking the document's narrative flow

### 3. SYNTHESIZE TO MATCH DOCUMENT

Transform raw content to match:
- **Tone:** Executive summary vs meeting minutes
- **Style:** Polished prose vs bullet points
- **Length:** 2-3 sentences vs detailed paragraphs
- **Flow:** Natural continuation, not interruption

### 4. QUALITY GATES (Before Every Insertion)

- [ ] Does synthesized content match document tone?
- [ ] Is length appropriate for section (not 10x longer)?
- [ ] Does it flow naturally from prior content?
- [ ] Is it presentation-ready (no raw note artifacts)?
- [ ] Would a manager/executive understand it standalone?
- [ ] Is formatting clean (NORMAL_TEXT style applied)?

### 5. THE TEST

**Ask yourself:** "If my boss saw only this document (not the notes), would they understand the insights and be able to make decisions?"

- **If no** → You're dumping notes, not synthesizing insights
- **If yes** → You're doing intelligent integration

- ❌ Create text-range comments reliably (anchor field doesn't work)
- ❌ Enable "Suggesting mode" programmatically

### Current Workarounds
- ✅ Use direct edits + document-level attribution comments
- ✅ Version history provides change tracking
- ✅ Comments explain what was synthesized and from where

### What We Handle
- ✅ Comment preservation during edits (insert-then-delete strategy)
- ✅ Formatting inheritance (explicit NORMAL_TEXT style)
- ✅ Section-targeted insertion
- ✅ Intelligent synthesis (not raw dumping)

## Comparison: When to Use This vs .docx Skill

### Use Google Docs skill when:
- ✅ Document lives in Google Drive
- ✅ Need intelligent content synthesis
- ✅ Target audience is executives/managers
- ✅ Want presentation-ready output
- ✅ Real-time collaboration needed
- ✅ Contextual comments explaining changes

### Use .docx skill when:
- ✅ Need formal tracked changes/redlining
- ✅ Legal, academic, or business document review
- ✅ Offline editing required

## Security & Privacy

- **OAuth 2.0** - Industry standard authentication
- **Credentials never in git** - `.gitignore` protects secrets
- **Tokens auto-refresh** - No repeated authentication
- **Minimal scopes** - Only necessary permissions:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` - Read and write docs
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` - Full Drive access (for comments)

**Revoke access anytime:** https://myaccount.google.com/permissions

## Development Status

| Phase 6 | 🚧 Planned | Packaging & polish |

**Current Status:** ~95% production-ready. Core functionality working.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```
Problem: "credentials.json not found"
Solution: Follow auth/oauth_setup.md step-by-step
```

```
Problem: "Token expired" or authentication fails
Solution: Delete ~/.claude-skills/gdocs/tokens.json and re-run test_auth.py
```

### Document Access Issues
```
Problem: "Document not found" or "Permission denied"
Solution:
  1. Verify you have at least View access to the document
  2. Check you're logged into correct Google account
  3. Verify document ID is correct
```

### Formatting Issues
```
Problem: Inserted text inherits header formatting
Solution: This is fixed - we explicitly set NORMAL_TEXT style
```

```
Problem: Comments disappear after edit
Solution: Use ContentInserter which preserves comments
```
