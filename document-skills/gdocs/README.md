# Google Docs Writing and Editing Skill

**Status:** Production-Ready ✅

A Claude skill that writes and updates Google Docs with intelligent content synthesis. Transforms raw content (notes, transcripts, research, drafts) into professional, document-appropriate text. It doesn't just insert content - it **analyzes**, **synthesizes**, and **integrates** intelligently.

## Key Innovation

Converts raw, unstructured content into polished, professional text that matches your document's tone, style, and purpose. For example: 3000+ character rough notes become 3-sentence executive summaries.

## What Makes This Different

### ❌ Traditional Approach (Raw Insertion)
```
Input:  Raw content (3,000+ chars of rough notes)
Action: Finds right section, appends everything
Result: Document bloated, unprofessional, needs cleanup
```

### ✅ Our Approach (Intelligent Synthesis)
```
Input:  Raw content (3,000+ chars of rough notes)
Action: Analyzes document, extracts key insights, synthesizes
Result: Professional, concise text (440 chars), presentation-ready
```

## Features

- 🧠 **Intelligent Synthesis** - Extracts key insights, not raw dumps
- 📊 **Document Analysis** - Understands purpose, audience, tone, style
- 📑 **Multi-Tab Support** - Automatically targets correct tab from URL
- 🏗️ **Structure-Aware** - Handles tables, lists, paragraphs intelligently
- ✏️ **Smart Insertion** - Comment-aware, proper formatting (NORMAL_TEXT)
- 💬 **Triple Attribution** - Contextual comments + inline markers + formatting
- 🔄 **OAuth Authentication** - Secure, one-time setup
- 📏 **Length Matching** - Respects document's length patterns
- 🎨 **Style Matching** - Adapts to executive vs detailed writing
- ⚠️ **Word Doc Detection** - Graceful handling of .docx limitations

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```

### 2. Set Up OAuth Credentials

Follow the detailed guide in [`auth/oauth_setup.md`](auth/oauth_setup.md):

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable Google Docs API and Drive API
3. Configure OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app)
5. Download `credentials.json` to the `auth/` directory

**Time:** ~5-10 minutes (one-time setup)

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
python examples/test_auth.py
```

This opens a browser for you to grant permissions. Credentials are saved for future use at `~/.claude-skills/gdocs/tokens.json`.

### 4. Try an Example

**Quick test:**
```bash
python examples/quick_merge_example.py
```

**Full intelligent synthesis example:**
```bash
python examples/intelligent_synthesis_example.py
```

## Usage

### Interactive Workflow (Recommended)

When you provide meeting notes and a Google Doc URL to Claude:

1. **Claude reads both** documents
2. **Claude analyzes** document purpose, style, tone
3. **Claude proposes synthesis** with preview
4. **You approve** or request adjustments
5. **Claude executes:**
   - Synthesizes content
   - Inserts at optimal location
   - Sets NORMAL_TEXT formatting
   - Adds attribution comment

### Example Transformation

**Input:** 3,189 character meeting transcript with detailed notes
```
📝 Meeting Notes — Customer Feedback on To-Do App
Date: October 31, 2025
Attendees: Product Manager: Sarah Lin, Customer: Alex Rivera
[... 3,189 characters of detailed notes ...]
```

**Output:** 440 character executive summary
```
Recent customer research with active Todoist users validates this approach
and reveals specific market opportunities. Users consistently report
"overwhelming task lists" and "lack of context" as primary frustrations,
directly supporting our planned focus mode and contextual attachment
features. Additionally, strong demand emerged for AI-assisted prioritization
and location-aware reminders, capabilities absent in current market leaders.
```

**Result:**
- ✅ 86% reduction in length
- ✅ Maintains executive tone
- ✅ Extracts key insights only
- ✅ Flows naturally from existing content
- ✅ Presentation-ready quality

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from scripts.gdocs_editor import GoogleDocsEditor
from scripts.content_inserter import ContentInserter, MergeOptions

editor = GoogleDocsEditor()
inserter = ContentInserter(editor)

# Merge synthesized content (Claude does the synthesis)
result = inserter.merge_content(
    doc_url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/DOC_ID/edit",
    content="[Claude's synthesized content]",
    section="Market Analysis",
    options=MergeOptions(
        preserve_comments=True,
        add_source_comment=True,
        source_description="customer feedback (10/31/25)"
    )
)

print(f"✓ Inserted at index {result['insertion_point'].index}")
print(f"✓ Comment ID: {result['new_comment_id']}")
```

## Core Principles

When Claude uses this skill:

1. **Analyze First** - Understand document purpose, audience, tone before synthesizing
2. **Extract Insights** - Not all details, just key 3-5 insights
3. **Synthesize to Match** - Match document's tone, style, and length patterns
4. **Quality Gates** - Check: Does it flow? Is it presentation-ready? Would exec understand?
5. **The Test** - "If boss saw only doc (not notes), could they make decisions?"

## Known Limitations

### What Google Docs API Cannot Do
- ❌ Create suggested edits programmatically
- ❌ Create text-range comments reliably (anchor field doesn't work for Docs)
- ❌ Enable "Suggesting mode" via API

### Our Workarounds
- ✅ Direct edits + document-level attribution comments
- ✅ Version history provides change tracking
- ✅ Comments explain what was synthesized and from where

See [`ATTRIBUTION_APPROACH.md`](ATTRIBUTION_APPROACH.md) for detailed explanation.

## Security & Privacy

- **OAuth 2.0** - Industry standard authentication
- **Credentials never in git** - `.gitignore` protects secrets
- **Tokens auto-refresh** - No repeated authentication
- **Minimal scopes** - Only necessary permissions:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` - Read and write docs
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` - Full Drive access (for comments)

**Revoke access anytime:** https://myaccount.google.com/permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** `credentials.json not found`
```bash
Solution: Follow auth/oauth_setup.md step-by-step
```

**Problem:** Token expired or authentication fails
```bash
Solution: Delete ~/.claude-skills/gdocs/tokens.json and re-run test_auth.py
```

**Problem:** `OAuth client was not found`
```bash
Solution:
1. Ensure credentials.json is in auth/ directory
2. Verify you've enabled both Docs API and Drive API
3. Check OAuth consent screen configuration
```

### Document Access Issues

**Problem:** `Document not found` or `Permission denied`
```bash
Solution:
1. Verify you have at least View access to document
2. Check you're logged into correct Google account
3. Verify document ID is correct
4. Ensure document isn't in trash
```

### Content Issues

**Problem:** Inserted text inherits header formatting
```bash
Solution: This is fixed - we explicitly set NORMAL_TEXT style
```

**Problem:** Comments disappear after edit
```bash
Solution: Use ContentInserter which preserves comments automatically
```

**Problem:** Synthesis doesn't match document tone
```bash
Solution: This is handled by Claude in conversation. Make sure to:
1. Let Claude read the full document first
2. Review Claude's synthesis preview before approving
3. Provide feedback if tone is off
```

See [`auth/oauth_setup.md`](auth/oauth_setup.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
